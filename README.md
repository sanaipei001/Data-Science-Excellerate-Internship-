Accelerate Data Science Sprint

This repository contains my work from the Data Science internship at Accelerate. The program was structured across several weeks, with each phase focusing on a core area of the data science lifecycle. I worked collaboratively with a global team using a unique dataset assigned to our group.

## Weekly Breakdown

- **Week 1 – Feature Engineering**  
  Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature transformation to prepare for analysis and modeling.

- **Week 2 – Data Visualization**  
  Created visual insights using Python (Seaborn & Matplotlib) to understand trends and relationships.

- **Week 3 – Prediction Modeling**  
  Built and evaluated machine learning models to predict key outcomes.

- **Week 4 – Insights & Reporting**  
  Compiled insights into a final report and prepared stakeholder-ready visualizations and summaries.
